# Web Crawling Project - Eventbrite 
Personal approach to web crawling for event information on Eventbrite

In this project, I created an initial process for finding, scraping, and wrangling event information from Enventbrite. The steps are detailed and tested in the jupyter notebooks in this repository.

This setup is a draft pipeline that could be implemented as a Heroku app or later integrated into a SQL database for connection to business development software.
